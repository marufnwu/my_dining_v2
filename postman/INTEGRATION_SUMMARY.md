  - Included IDs for various resources (mess, user, expense, purchase)
  - Maintained backward compatibility

- **Updated production.postman_environment.json:**
  - Added same variables as development
  - Provided better default values
  - Maintained security best practices

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Updated README.md:**
  - Clear guidance on using the new merged collection
  - Detailed API endpoint coverage
  - Complete testing workflows
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Best practices for API testing and CI/CD integration
